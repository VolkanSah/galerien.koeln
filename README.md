# ⚡ Minimalist Landing Page – 100/100 Google PageSpeed Out of the Box

This is a handcrafted, **HTML + CSS only** landing page – no JavaScript, no external libraries, no fancy build tools. Just pure, clean code that hits **100/100** on Google PageSpeed Insights (Mobile & Desktop) and **GTmetrix A-Grade** without any optimization magic.

[Demo](https://galerien.koeln)

## 🚀 What’s inside

- Fully responsive layout
- Semantic HTML5
- Pure CSS animations and effects
- Zero dependencies
- No cookies, no trackers, no external fonts
- Blazing fast performance (without tuning or caching)

## 💡 Why this exists

Sometimes, you just want to show what’s possible without 20MB of JavaScript frameworks or a bloated design system.  
This page was originally built as a **creative job application** – a digital mic drop – and it worked.

Now it’s yours to use, remix, or learn from. No strings attached.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> _“Real performance comes from clean thinking, not from tools.”_

This repo is a reminder:  
You don’t need a team of consultants or a thousand-dollar CMS to build something beautiful, fast, and expressive. All you need is vision, a keyboard, and maybe a little coffee.
